/*
  PhotoSensor AutoLED ON
 Demonstrates analog input by reading a photo sensor on analog pin 0 and
 turning on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to digital pin 2.
 The amount of time the LED will be on and off depends on
 the value obtained by analogRead().

 The circuit:
 * Photosensor attached to analog input 0
 * one side pin (either one) to ground
 * the other side pin to +5V
 * LED anode (long leg) attached to digital output 2
 * LED cathode (short leg) attached to ground
